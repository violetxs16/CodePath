#Problem 2: Protein Folding Loop Detection
#As a biochemist, you're studying the folding patterns of proteins, 
# which are represented as a sequence of amino acids linked together. 
# These proteins sometimes fold back on themselves, creating loops that 
# can impact their function.

#Given the head of a linked list protein where each node in the linked 
# list represents an amino acid in the protein, return an array with the 
# values of any cycle in the list. A linked list has a cycle if at some 
# point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

#The values may be returned in any order.

#Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your 
# variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution 
# has the stated time and space complexity.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

def cycle_length(protein):
    pass

protein_head = Node('Ala', Node('Gly', Node('Leu', Node('Val'))))
protein_head.next.next.next.next = protein_head.next 

print(cycle_length(protein_head))
