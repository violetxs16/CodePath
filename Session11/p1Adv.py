#Problem 1: Selective DNA Deletion
#As a biologist, you are working on editing a long strand of DNA represented 
# as a linked list of nucleotides. Each nucleotide in the sequence is represented 
# as a node in the linked list, where each node contains a character ('A', 'T', 'C', 'G') 
# representing the nucleotide.

#Given the head of the linked list dna_strand and two integers m and n, write 
# a function edit_dna_sequence() that simulates the selective deletion of 
# nucleotides in a DNA sequence. You will: - Start at the beginning of the DNA strand.
#  - Retain the first m nucleotides from the current position. - Remove the next 
# n nucleotides from the sequence. - Repeat the process until the end of the DNA 
# strand is reached.

#Return the head of the modified DNA sequence after removing the mentioned nucleotides.

#Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables 
# and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time 
# and space complexity.

class Node:
   def __init__(self, value, next=None):
       self.value = value
       self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def edit_dna_sequence(dna_strand, m, n):
    pass

dna_strand = Node(1, Node(2, Node(3, Node(4, Node(5, Node(6, Node(7, Node(8, Node(9, Node(10, Node(11, Node(12, Node(13)))))))))))))

print_linked_list(selective_trail_clearing(dna_strand, 2, 3))

#1 -> 2 -> 6 -> 7 -> 11 -> 12
#Explanation: Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List  
#(1 -> 2) show in black nodes.
#Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in red nodes.
#Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.
