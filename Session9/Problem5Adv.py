#Problem 5: Linked Up
#A linked list is a new data type that, similar to a normal list or array, allows us to 
# store pieces of data sequentially. The difference between a linked list and a normal list
#  lies in how each element is stored in a computer’s memory.

#In a normal list, individual elements of the list are stored in adjacent memory locations 
# according to the order they appear in the list. If we know where the first element of the list is stored, 
# it’s really easy to find any other element in the list.

#In a linked list, the individual elements called nodes are not stored in sequential memory locations. 
# Each node may be stored in an unrelated memory location. To connect nodes together into a sequential list, 
# each node stores a reference or pointer to the next node in the list.

#Connect the provided node instances below to create the linked list kk_slider -> harriet -> saharah -> isabelle.

#A function print_linked_list() which accepts the head, or first element, of a linked list and prints the 
# values of the list has also been provided for testing purposes.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

kk_slider = Node("K.K. Slider")
harriet = Node("Harriet")
saharah = Node("Saharah")
isabelle = Node("Isabelle")
kk_slider.next = harriet
harriet.next = saharah
saharah.next = isabelle
# Add code here to link the above nodes
#Example Usage:

print_linked_list(kk_slider)
