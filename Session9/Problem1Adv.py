#Problem 1: Villager Class
#A class constructor is a special method or function that is used to create and initialize 
# a new object from a class. Define the class constructor __init__() for a new class Villager 
# that represents characters in the game Animal Crossing. The constructor accepts three required 
# arguments: strings name, species, and catchphrase. The constructor defines four properties for a Villager:

#name, a string initialized to the argument name
#species, a string initialized to the argument species
#catchphrase, a string initialized to the argument catchphrase
#furniture, a list initialized to an empty list
class Villager:
    def __init__(self, name, species, catchphrase):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.catchphrase = catchphrase
        self.furniture = []
#Example Usage:

apollo = Villager("Apollo", "Eagle", "pah")
print(apollo.name)
print(apollo.species) 
print(apollo.catchphrase)
print(apollo.furniture)
