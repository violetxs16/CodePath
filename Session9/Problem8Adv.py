#Problem 8: Restocking the Lake
#Imagine that Animal Crossing is still using a linked list to represent the order fish will 
# appear to a player who is fishing! The head of the list represents the next fish that a player 
# will catch if they keep fishing.

#Write a function restock() that accepts the head of a linked list and a string new_fish, and adds 
# a Node with the fish_name new_fish to the end of the list. Return the head of the modified list.

#A function print_linked_list() which accepts the head, or first element, of a linked list and 
# prints the list data has also been provided for testing purposes.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, fish_name, next=None):
        self.fish_name = fish_name
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.fish_name, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def restock(head, new_fish):
    fish = head
    while(fish.next):
        fish = fish.next
    fish.next = Node(new_fish)
    return head
#Example Usage:

fish_list = Node("Carp", Node("Dace", Node("Cherry Salmon")))
print_linked_list(restock(fish_list, "Rainbow Trout"))
#Example Output:

#Carp -> Dace -> Cherry Salmon -> Rainbow Trout
