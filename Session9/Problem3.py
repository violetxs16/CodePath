#Problem 3: Update Catchphrase
#In Animal Crossing, as players become friends with villagers, the villagers might ask the player to suggest a new catchphrase.

#Adding on to your existing code, update bones so that his catchphrase is "ruff it up" instead of its current value, "yip yip".

#Example Usage:

print(bones.greet_player("Samia"))
