#Problem 4: Set Character
#In the previous exercise, we accessed and modified a player’s catchphrase attribute directly. Instead of allowing users to update their player directly, it is common to create setter methods that users can call to update class attributes. This has a few different benefits, including allowing us to validate data before updating our class instance.

#Update your Villager class with a method set_catchphrase() that takes in one parameter new_catchphrase.

#If new_catchphrase is valid, it should update the villager's catchphrase attribute to have value new_catchphrase and print "Catchphrase updated".
#Otherwise, it should print out "Invalid catchphrase".
#Valid catchphrases are less than 20 characters in length. They must all contain only alphabetic and whitespace characters.

class Villager:
    def __init__(self, name, species, catchphrase):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.catchphrase = catchphrase
        self.furniture = []
	
    def set_catchphrase(self, new_catchphrase):
        pass
#Example Usage:

alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "guvnor")

alice.set_catchphrase("sweet dreams")
print(alice.catchphrase)
alice.set_catchphrase("#?!")
print(alice.catchphrase)
