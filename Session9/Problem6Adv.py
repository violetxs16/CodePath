#Problem 6: Got One!
#Imagine that behind the scenes, Animal Crossing uses a linked list to represent the order fish will 
# appear to a player who is fishing in the river. The head of the list represents the next fish that a 
# player will catch if they keep fishing.

#Write a function catch_fish() that accepts the head of a list. The function should:

#Print the name of the fish in the head node using the format "I caught a <fish name>!".
#Remove the first node in the list.
#The function should return the new head of the list. If the list is empty, print "Aw! Better luck next time!" 
# and return None.

#A function print_linked_list() which accepts the head, or first element, of a linked list and prints the list 
# data has also been provided for testing purposes.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, fish_name, next=None):
        self.fish_name = fish_name
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.fish_name, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def catch_fish(head):
    if head == None:
        print("Aw! Better luck next time!")
        return None
    fish = head
    head = head.next
    print(f"I caught a {fish.fish_name}!")
    return head
#Example Usage:

fish_list = Node("Carp", Node("Dace", Node("Cherry Salmon")))
empty_list = None

print_linked_list(fish_list)
print_linked_list(catch_fish(fish_list))
print(catch_fish(empty_list))
