#Problem 4: Scheduling Conflict
#Demand for your festival has exceeded expectations, so you're expanding the festival to span 
# two different venues. Some artists will perform both venues, while others will perform at just one. 
# To ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts, implement a function identify_conflicts() that 
# accepts two dictionaries venue1_schedule and venue2_schedule each mapping the artists playing at 
# the venue to their set times. Return a dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are the same in each schedule.

def identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule):
    dic = {}
    for key in venue1_schedule:
        if key in venue2_schedule and venue1_schedule[key] == venue2_schedule[key]:#values are the same?
            dic[key] = venue1_schedule[key] #adding to scheduling conflict dictionary
    return dic 
#Example Usage:

venue1_schedule = {
    "Stromae": "9:00 PM",
    "Janelle Monáe": "8:00 PM",
    "HARDY": "7:00 PM",
    "Bruce Springsteen": "6:00 PM"
}

venue2_schedule = {
    "Stromae": "9:00 PM",
    "Janelle Monáe": "10:30 PM",
    "HARDY": "7:00 PM",
    "Wizkid": "6:00 PM"
}

print(identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule))
#Example Output:

#{"Stromae": "9:00 PM", "HARDY": "7:00 PM"}
#Understading: returning conflicts within the dictionary
