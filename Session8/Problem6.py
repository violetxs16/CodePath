#Problem 6: NFT Queue Processing
#NFTs are added to a processing queue before they are displayed. 
# The queue processes NFTs in a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) manner. 
# Each NFT has a processing time, and you need to determine the order 
# in which NFTs should be processed based on their initial position in the queue.

#Write the process_nft_queue() function, which takes a list of NFTs. 
# The function should return a list of NFT names in the order they were processed.

#Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your 
# variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

def process_nft_queue(nft_queue):
    lst = []
    for nft in nft_queue:
        lst.append(nft["name"])
    return lst
#Space and time complexity O(N)
#Example Usage:

nft_queue = [
    {"name": "Abstract Horizon", "processing_time": 2},
    {"name": "Pixel Dreams", "processing_time": 3},
    {"name": "Urban Jungle", "processing_time": 1}
]
print(process_nft_queue(nft_queue))

nft_queue_2 = [
    {"name": "Golden Hour", "processing_time": 4},
    {"name": "Sunset Serenade", "processing_time": 2},
    {"name": "Ocean Waves", "processing_time": 3}
]
print(process_nft_queue(nft_queue_2))

nft_queue_3 = [
    {"name": "Crypto Kitty", "processing_time": 5},
    {"name": "Galactic Voyage", "processing_time": 6}
]
print(process_nft_queue(nft_queue_3))
